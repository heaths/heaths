* 👨‍💻 I'm currently working on [Azure SDKs](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/) and serving on the REST API Stewardship board, most notably working on the Azure [Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/key-vault?view=azure-dotnet) and some [Cognitive Service for Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/concepts/developer-guide) SDKs.
* 👨‍💻 Previously, I was the architect for the Visual Studio Setup engine and still work on a number of setup-related projects including [vswhere](https://github.com/microsoft/vswhere).
* 🪵 While I mainly use it for easy reference material, check out my [blog](https://heaths.dev).
